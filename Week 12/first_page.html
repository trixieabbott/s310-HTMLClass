  Hello World!

    <h1>This is an H1 heading.</h1>
  
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is a second paragraph</p>

    <h2>Heading 2</h2>

    <p>My third paragraph</p>

    <h2>Heading 2 Again</h2>

    <p>I love interesting quotes. Here is a good one. 
    <q>Opportunities don't happen. You create them.</q>
    It is from Chris Grosser. </p>

    <p>If you have a longer quote, you can separate it out better
        using the blockquote element.  It will look something like this...
    <blockquote><hr />There are two types of people who will tell you that you 
    cannot make a difference in this world: those who are afraid to 
    try and those who are afraid you will succeed.<hr /></blockquote>
    The rest of the paragraph will continue after the quote.</p>

    <p>If we want to show code: <pre>the PRE element is good to use</pre>
    It separates the line of text and makes it monotype which is easier to 
    read when looking at code.</p>

    <p>Sometimes we have text that we want to drop<br />to a new line. In 
    that case we can use a break tag to do that.</p>


    <hr/>
    <p>An HR tag makes a line across the page.</p>
